Solve Euler square problem using Evolutionary Algorithm,Hill Climbing Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization
Also do:
Separate some specific validation tests will be performed and the results will be
displayed - the average and standard deviation for the best solutions found by your
algorithm after 1000 evaluations of the fitness function in 30 runs, with populations of 40
individuals.
A plot depicting the fitness variation during the validations.
